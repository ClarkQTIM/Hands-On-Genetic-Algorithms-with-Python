# Hands-On-Genetic-Algorithms-with-Python
This is a repository for my work-through of the book *Hands-On Genetic Algorithms with Python* by Eyal Wirsansky. It contains a document outlining the basics of Genetic Algorithms (GA), correspoinding to chapters 1 and 2 from the book, and the worked-through scripts the accompany the text. The originals can be found at: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Genetic-Algorithms-with-Python (9/12/2022).
